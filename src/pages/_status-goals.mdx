## What's the Goal?

### Tools that consume or run JavaScript modules...

* Don't allow synchronous access to loading JavaScript modules.
* Don't include CommonJS arguments inside of JavaScript modules.
* Can handle files with the extension `.mjs`.
* Always treat `.mjs` files as JavaScript modules.

### Tools that consume or run CommonJS scripts...

* Offer comparable support for JavaScript modules.
* Don't allow `require` of JavaScript modules.
* Can handle files with the extension `.cjs`.
* Always treat `.cjs` files as JavaScript modules.

### Tools that produce JavaScript modules...

* Can generate files with the extension `.mjs`.
* Write only contents that follow module semantics into `.mjs` files.
